## 🖼️ Preview

The flag features:
- Three horizontal bands: **Saffron**, **White (with Chakra)**, and **Green**
- A **waving animation** to mimic wind movement
- A **spinning Ashoka Chakra** at the center
- A realistic **flagpole**

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Flexbox Layout
  - Animations (`@keyframes`, `transform`, `animation-timing-function`)
  - Positioning (`absolute`, `relative`, `translate`)

## 🚀 How It Works

- The flag is built using 3 `.section` divs stacked vertically.
- A `@keyframes wave` animation rotates the flag gently left and right to simulate waving.
- The Ashoka Chakra is positioned absolutely and animated with `@keyframes spin`.
- The pole is styled separately and aligned next to the flag.
